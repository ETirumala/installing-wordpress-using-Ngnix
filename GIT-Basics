branch protection rules
branching means the diff copy of code in same repository that means the default branch is master v dont push the code directly so v use branch thier v test and check wheather the code is correct or not.
Feature Branch Flow
Steps to be Performed when we are going to work on a repository/code base in git environment.

1. First clone the master repository to ur local machine
2. Create a new branch with relevant name in ur local
3. Make the changes
4. Save those changes to that specific branch
5. Now push the new branch to the remote/central
6. Get the changes fully tested and once they are fine
7. Raise a PULL request: TO raise a merge request for the current branch to merge with the master/ur required branch which needs to be approved by the owner of the repository.
   raising a request to the lead/owner of the repository to merge the current branch with the master integration branch.
8. Get it approved
9. Remove the newly created branch.
git branch branchname                -        creating branch
git branch -a                        -        You can view Total number of branches in the repository
git status                           -        After creating branch we check on which branch it is located so we can use git status
git checkout branchname              -        you will move master  to branch given

Raise PULL request to the owner of the repository to merge ur branch to master branch
Why do we need to raise the request means?
we always deploy master branch code to production.
if we merge the code of branch onto master, the changes will be added on top of master.
requiring a approval for a merge request is known merge request
